      We always need new volunteers, and we are very happy to have them. We will provide all the necessary training.  If you can speak English, you can make a difference in someone’s life.


      New tutors attend two consecutive Saturday sessions with our trainers, who are professional certified ESL teachers from local colleges. We hold these training classes 4 to 5 times per year at varying locations. At the bottom of the page, you can see prospective tutors having fun in a recent class. Upon completion, you will receive a certificate allowing you to work as a Laubach Literacy tutor at any of our sites in San Diego County.

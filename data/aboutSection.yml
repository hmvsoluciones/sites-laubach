  ### Brief Overview

  Laubach Literacy Council of San Diego County celebrated its 58th year of service in 2019 as a 100% volunteer organization. We tutor at over 30 locations throughout San Diego County, and currently have around 200 tutors and around 800 students. 


  The demographics of each tutoring center vary with the population of the surrounding community â€“ we have learners originally from Asia, Africa, Mexico, Central America, and South America. Tutoring takes place in library study rooms throughout the County as well as in various community centers and church facilities.


  The Council also provides tutor training with professional trainers through collaboration with the San Diego County Library. Training to tutors is offered free of charge four to five times per year.
